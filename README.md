# Graph Dominating Set

This repository is a testing and development ground for finding (ideally) a minimal dominating set of any random graph. Currently, the algorithm works only on small, undirected, and unweighted graphs. Additionally, it is not yet optimized for performance.

## How to Use

1. Fill the `adj_list.txt` file following the given template:
   - The **first line** should contain the number of vertices.
   - The **following lines** should contain the adjacency list for each vertex.
2. After preparing the input file, compile and run the main.cpp program.
3. The console will display a valid (and potentially minimal) dominating set for the given graph.
